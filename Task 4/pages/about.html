<p>Greetings, I'm Fares, a Dad, music player, Technical Support Engineer and on my journey to become a developer, 
    with over 9 years in the support industry. My journey blends technology and leadership, 
    shaped during five years as a Team Manager at Dropbox Technical Support. Leading multicultural teams, 
    navigating reporting complexities, and championing SMART objectives, I've also spearheaded innovative projects, 
    from digitizing the interview process to bridging technology and exceptional customer experiences. 
    Currently pursuing CCBA certification and full stack development expertise. 
    I bring a unique blend of managerial expertise and a passion for the evolving tech landscape. 
    Excited to contribute, collaborate, learn and eager to explore new opportunities.</p>
